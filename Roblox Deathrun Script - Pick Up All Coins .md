<h1>Roblox Deathrun Script - Pick Up All Coins</h1>

Originally developed as a modification for *Counter-Strike 1.6*, Roblox Deathrun transitioned into the Roblox platform due to its inventive gameplay, offering a unique mode where players navigate treacherous obstacle courses to survive dynamic hazards. Continuously updated for seasonal events, the mode introduces fresh challenges and mechanics to maintain engagement. Its standout feature is a custom-built engine supporting creatively designed maps filled with traps and interactive elements, requiring quick reflexes and strategy. Players choose between two roles: "runners" avoiding dangers or a "killer" triggering obstacles to eliminate others. Victories culminate in survivors confronting the killer in a final showdown. While the mode emphasizes skill over automated scripts, a rare exception existsâ€”a "Pick Up All Coins" script streamlining coin collection across maps, though such tools remain uncommon in its gameplay ecosystem.
